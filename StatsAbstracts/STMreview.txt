### STM review

This is an excellent vignette for an excellent package.  I have been aware of the STM work but have not actually used their code before now.  I am impressed with the range of functionality, the ease of use, and the performance.  This vignette is also well written and informative.  I will be recommending both the package and this document to my students and colleagues.

There are no changes I would _require_ for publication.  I do have some minor advice and reports on my experience with the vignette/package.  These are listed below and I hope they are useful.

* maybe print one element of your out$documents list (or a few columns of one element) so that the uninitiated can see what this object looks like.  
* it is common that the data come pre-tokenized (e.g., when comparing many methods or as part of a larger pipeline) into sparse document term matrices.  e.g., as a common slam simple triplet matrix.  I converted to your doc format with
	docs =  lapply(split(cbind(x$j,x$v), x$i), 
		function(jv) matrix(jv, nrow=2, byrow=TRUE))
* I couldn't connect to the cleaned data url: http://goo.gl/tsprNO
* perhaps warn readers from the outset that a saved workspace is available.  Some readers (e.g., me) prefer to run code as they read these vignettes and would have skipped to the saved workspace.
* typo in first paragraph of 3.4: forthcomingb.
* add all argument names in the first stm function call on page 9
* plotModels didn't work with a single model.  Maybe this is assumed, but it returned a bunch of "non missing arguments to min/max" type errors and this seems not what you'd want.
* I'm still a bit confused by estimateEffect.  I had thought that the regression you are running here is part of the STM generative model and estimated during the main model fit.  It seems strange that, e.g., plot.estimateEffect requires both the output of estimateEffect and the original model fit.  Perhaps this could be tightened up in the exposition.
* can we get a summary of the results of estimateEffect?  something like summary(prep) using the variable you created.  I would love to see something analogous to the coefficient table in summary.lm (with bayes uncertainty instead of sampling errors, etc) for your 'gamma' parameter in equation (1).
* I didn't see it, but perhaps emphasize that your notation (greek letters) matches the names in the STM S3 object (it does right?)
* on page 20, poliblogContent is used to make the plot before it is defined.  I find it a bit confusing if the code doesn't appear in order.
